# HeartDiseasePrediction-6thSEMProject
This collaborative project, "Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning," was undertaken by a dedicated team of four individuals: Garima Paudel, Anisha Silwal, Aayushma Paudel, and Nisha Pokharel.
Our project is aimed at helping individuals and healthcare professionals predict the presence or absence of heart disease with high accuracy. We have developed a machine learning algorithm that utilizes various input parameters such as age, sex, cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol, height, and weight to make these predictions.
